            <h1>The Problem</h1>
            <p>After thinking long and hard about the different types of problems for college students, we came to realize the most obvious.</p>

            <p>With UCI constantly telling us in the dining halls about the amount of food waste that exists on campus, as well as witnessing it first hand, we came with the following problem statement:</p>

            <h2>How might we create a better way for individual home cooks aged 18 - 25 to make healthier recipes using their current ingredients?</h2>

                <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
    
                <p>As a group, we looked into various different recipe-related apps online to see how they compare to one another. We looked through <a href="https://lifesum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nonreferrer">Lifesum</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercook.app&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nonreferrer">Supercook</a>, <a href="https://foodcombo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nonreferrer">FoodCombo</a>, <a href="https://cooklist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nonreferrer">Cooklist</a>, and <a href="https://www.foodvisor.io/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nonreferrer">Foodvisor</a>.</p>
    
                <p>By comparing all of these different apps, we managed to get a better idea of how our app should come about.</p>

            <h1>Takeaways from our interviews</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Carlos P2: she gets her recipes using YouTube or TikTok, both of which are (technically) freely available. So, having to pay may not sit right with them.</li>
                <li>Phuong P1: “To me, accessibility (able to access and log quickly), be able to favorite food and recipes, along with correct nutritional information (accuracy), are some of the aspects that are important to me”</li>
                <li>Ayush P2: The interviewee noted that as a beginner cook, he would like to have pictures of each step during the cooking process because that would help him greatly while he was cooking.</li>
                <li>Denise P2: “I wish most websites had a halal option(no red meat or pork)”</li>
                <li>Ricardo P1: Both interviewees would appreciate it if the YouTube videos they watched to get their recipes contained the recipe's macronutrients, calorie count, and in general all of the recipe's nutritional information.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>With the interviews and storyboards done, we got to work on lofi sketches to give us a rough idea as to how the app is going to look like. This is what came out of the lofi sketches.</p>
