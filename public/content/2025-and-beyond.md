# A Reminder for 2025 and Beyond

## A Missing Vision for the Future

There have been moments in my life where people ask me what I want to do with my
future, and I never really know what to say. Until now, I think most of my life
has been focused on milestones. In K-12, my goal was to get into college, and I
did as I was admitted as a freshman to [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) in
Fall 2021. Beyond that, I wasn't exactly sure what was next. I know the very
simple details: I graduate, I get a job, and then... what?

While at UC Irvine, I always understood it was a fantastic opportunity. I get
to interact with other people who have similar interests as me and want to
explore the computer science field. The thought of that was really exciting to
me as I loved computer science. I had tried to join a few organizations, with
my personal favorite being [Design at UCI](https://designatuci.com/), but it
still didn't feel quite right. I didn't feel like I found my "community" yet. I
later found out that I wanted to join an open-source organization, but this was
discovered late into my college career. (At the time, I wanted to join a group
that "makes programs for fun, without finances involved.") Had I joined an
organization, I'd have probably explored mentorship opportunities, or ask
questions about the job industry. It's *very* easy to say that behind a screen
without having to face social anxiety, though.

It was maybe around January 2024 (*three years into college*) that I felt like I
knew how I wanted things to go. I wanted to be a software developer at a
company, but spend my free time in open-source software. In a perfect world, a
company would pay me to work in open-source. This probably won't happen unless
I work at a super big company [like Google](https://opensource.google/).

## Values

The more I think about the future, the more I realize I first need to take time
to identify my values. I spent a little bit of time on this in therapy, though
for different reasons. :)

As of late, I feel like I have a clearer idea of who I want to become. Great
timing too, since I'm due to graduate soon. Although I know I'm not perfect by
any means, clarifying my values will help me figure out the direction I'd like
to go in my life.

### Open-Source Software (OSS)

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software):

> ***Open-source software (OSS)*** *is computer software that is released under
> a license in which the copyright holder grants users the right to use, study,
> change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone for any
> purpose.*

I want to be an advocate for open-source software. OSS makes it possible to
freely use software in an accessible and transparent way. Growing up, I've often
[heard rumors about how computer programs are spying on us](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/talking-angela-warning/).
In some cases, [they weren't even rumors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s_global_surveillance_disclosures).

OSS makes it so that experts can freely examine the source code, ensuring that
a program is safe. What's better is that it doesn't even have to be an expert.
The source code should be freely available to audit, regardless of expertise
level, because that's *transparency*. You have nothing to hide, right?

My proudest OSS contribution is [Iris](https://github.com/ojosproject/iris/), a
program I'm helping build at UC Irvine with the
[Ojos Project](https://ojosproject.org/). I plan to publish a blog post about
it in June 2025.

### Security/Privacy

I believe users are entitled to secure software. Software should be transparent
in how it's designed so that users can make informed decisions about what
they're using. Likewise, software developers should ensure users' data is secure
and safe in a way that a user doesn't even have to think about it. Think
[passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/). I'm a big fan of them, as well
as any
[public-private key encryption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSIDS_lvRv4),
because it greatly enhances your digital security while also being a seamless
process. At least, a seamless process to use. In my mind, passkeys perfected
public-private key authentication.

I also think that encryption is a must in most software. I've recently been a
big fan of [GPG](https://gnupg.org/). I'm using
[LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to write this blog, and I've
recently noticed that Writer has a GPG implementation that
[allows you to encrypt your document's content using your GPG key](https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/shared/guide/openpgp.html).
This is truly beautiful.

### User Experience

Growing up, I was the family technician. If something wasn't working on a phone,
I'd typically figure it out for us. There were moments where I would want to
make iOS easier for my grandma to use. It required me to focus on her experience
as a user, even if I didn't know it at the time.

I believe that user experience should be a focus for all software. If you
provide a bad UX, then people won't want to use your program. If you provide a
good UX, people will use your program. Create a great UX and people will *want*
to use your program.

One of the most interesting parts of my Informatics degree is UI/UX research.
Some of our assignments required that we build an app to interview people
using the app and get feedback about its usefulness. We'd also actively take
notes as they're using the program to see if they get stuck or don't know what
to do. It's one of the reasons I (eventually) chose Informatics as my degree:
we *have* to talk to users and confirm that our product is useful *and*
effective.

### History

This is something kind of new to me, and I don't quite know what else to call it
besides "history." One of the things that I love about Git is the fact that it
keeps track of a project's history. We can go through the old Git logs and see
the changes being made as they were written.

I keep a collection of Git(Hub) commits/PRs of historically significant
changes, or
[just to find something funny](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/pull/155).

There are other things I like doing that I don't often see my peers doing. I
(occasionally) use [vim](https://www.vim.org/), I navigate my files using the
terminal, I
[participate in mailing lists](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/fedora-join@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/DC6VGN4RNPCFUQKTLTAFZQN3UZBVC4RS/),
I keep GPG keys, etc.

I enjoy using some of the tools developers from the past used, even if they're
sometimes significantly harder or not user friendly, because these are the same
tools that built the cyberspace as we know it.

## Until Now

So, the point of this post. Originally, it was to help me write the "About Me"
section of [my website](/#about-me), but its become something more personal to
me. It's become more of a reminder to myself. A place for me to come back to
whenever I'm feeling lost in the world. It's a big world with a lot of
experiences, so feeling lost sometimes is inevitable. The important part is to
eventually find your path again. So, for my "About Me" section:

> I am Carlos Valdez, a software developer from California. I'm a passionate
> full-stack developer with a mission to make software easier to understand
> through UI/UX design. I build software from the ground up based on the needs
> of a project. I focus on solutions that prioritize a user's experience and

This sounds about right. :)

## Beyond

2024 was an [adjective] year for me. I met people I'll never forget, I learned
so much ([Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) being my personal favorite), and I
was able to continue working on things I care about.

Here's to 2025 and beyond. I'm excited for where my future is headed. Although I
may not know exactly *where* I'm heading, I *know* I'm heading somewhere.
Hopefully 2025 will let me know where.

:^)
