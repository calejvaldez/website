# Research

## Background

I don't really know when I first became interested in research. The idea of
being able to contribute something to a university always fascinated me. It just
felt like it was the "next step" to my academic career.

In Winter 2023, I had coffee with one of my professors,
[Dr. Paul Dourish](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/explore/faculty-profiles/paul-dourish/).
He made an effort to meet with students and just talk, which was amazing since
I am too anxious to do something like that myself. He had asked us what our
goals were for our time at the University, and I said I didn't exactly know, but
that I wanted to do *some* kind of research. The conversation didn't go much
further than that, but it was the first time I ever told someone I wanted to
participate in research.

## Oppenheimer (2023)

Fast forward to that summer, [Oppenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film))
was released. I don't know what it was about this movie that fascinated me with
the idea of doing research at a university. Oppenheimer's research took place
at UC Berkeley, so I guess that's where my fascination took off more than it
already was. Funnily enough, I also became fascinated with emails. Emails being
associated with an institution kind of gives people an identity, and I think
that's interesting.

## Ojos Project Origins

Anyways, Oppenheimer got me even more interested in research, so I decided to
email one of my former professors,
[Dr. Mark Baldwin](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/explore/faculty-profiles/mark-baldwin/),
and asked him if he had any research opportunities for students. To my surprise,
he did. He wanted to start something called the Undergraduate Research Lab, and
so asked me to submit a proposal. In Summer 2022, my grandma had passed away, so
I knew I wanted to do something in honor of her. So, I wanted to come up with a
device that would help hospice patients become more independent. That proposal
and email exchange is what basically started the
[Ojos Project](https://ojosproject.org/).

## Looking Back

As of now, I've spent two quarters with my project and gathered a fantastic
team to help me. We spoke with caregivers and healthcare professionals to try to
build a useful device for hospice patients. We're still researching and
gathering the requirements needed, but we're doing good progress. My hope is to
have a prototype ready by the end of Spring quarter.

I can't wrap up everything I've done in this blog post, so [I wrote another post
at the Ojos Project website that covers more.](https://ojosproject.org/news/winter-2024-wrap/) I'm grateful to have the opportunity to fullfil my dream as
a student researcher and being able to build something that would've been useful
to my grandmother during her time in hospice. I can't wait to see what the
future has in store.
