## Instructions for development

I don't really assume anybody's going to add content to my website. This is for me because I tend to forget how stuff works.

### Sass

Instead of basic CSS, I use Sass. Here is how to install it:

```bash
sudo npm install -g sass
```

Once installed, you can run it from the terminal. I make it so that it refreshes while I'm still coding:

```bash
sass --watch src/static/styles:src/static/styles
```

For more information, please consult [the documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/).
